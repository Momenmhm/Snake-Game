This is a Snake game project built with Python's turtle library. It's designed to be a simplified version of the classic game, playable on a mobile-like interface.
​Key Features and Functionality
​This project is a classic Snake game with a simple, touch-based control scheme tailored for a mobile experience.
​Touch-Based Controls: Instead of traditional keyboard controls, the snake's direction is changed by clicking or tapping anywhere on the screen. The snake then turns to move toward the tapped location. This makes it playable on a touchscreen device.
​Dynamic Snake Growth: When the snake's head touches the food, a new segment is added to its body, and the score increases. The snake gets longer with each piece of food eaten.
​Random Food Placement: Food appears at random locations on the screen, adding a new challenge after each piece is eaten.
​Collision Detection: The game ends if the snake's head hits the screen boundaries or its own body. A "GAME OVER" message is displayed, and the screen turns red.
​Scoring System: The player's score is displayed on the screen and updates as they eat food.
​How it's Structured
​The code is organized into three main classes:
​Snake: This class handles the snake's creation, movement, and direction changes based on touch input. It manages the snake's body segments as a list of Turtle objects.
​Food: This class handles the food's appearance, placement, and disappearance after being eaten.
​Screen_board: This class manages the game's display, including the score, and displays the "GAME OVER" message.
​The main game loop continuously moves the snake and checks for collisions and food consumption to manage the game state.EnterTThis is a Snake game project built with Python's turtle library. It's designed to be a simplified version of the classic game, playable on a mobile-like interface.
